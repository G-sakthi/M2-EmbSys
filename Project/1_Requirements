# INTRODUCTION

Sitting is one of the most common postures of human being in day-to-day life.People spend a long time on sitting in an office chair or lounge chair. Biomedical
engineering, public healthcare service and facility design are sitting behavior analysis becomes an important research topic recently in a variety of domain. An average adult watches television or relaxes for two hours a day. Working
hours which are mostly eight in an average case, start standing at least two hours of those eight hours. However, every person tries to push those two hours to four hours
for relaxation and decreases stress level. This means that at work the person should spend as much time standing as the person sit. The prolonged sitting has been equated
with not just obesity, heart disease and diabetes but also with depression, cancer, joint pains and muscle problems. It is so harmful that is repercussions have been equated to
that of the smoking or HIV.Until now, people are absolutely failing to understand or even acknowledge the need to stand more. These Diseased people have a significant impact on office
productivity. With respect to avoid the adverse effects of poor sitting behavior, the real-time monitoring of sitting posture has received particular attention.
In previous method the sitting positions are monitored, and the mechanism involved was moving and bending approach installed in chair and cost is more to get
the soft sitting chair. Due to this, companies face productivity loss as well as the employees stress level gets increased. To overcome this our project comes up with the
idea of developing a system with low power consumption and low computing overhead and additional features include a position motor to re-position the chair to the original
position.
