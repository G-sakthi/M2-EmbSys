# 1 Introduction
Sitting is one of the most common postures of human being in day-to-day life.
People spend a long time on sitting in an office chair or lounge chair. Biomedical
engineering, public healthcare service and facility design are sitting behavior analysis
becomes an important research topic recently in a variety of
domain. An average adult watches television or relaxes for two hours a day. Working
hours which are mostly eight in an average case, start standing at least two hours of
those eight hours. However, every person tries to push those two hours to four hours
for relaxation and decreases stress level. This means that at work the person should
spend as much time standing as the person sit. The prolonged sitting has been equated
with not just obesity, heart disease and diabetes but also with depression, cancer, joint
pains and muscle problems. It is so harmful that is repercussions have been equated to
that of the smoking or HIV.
Until now, people are absolutely failing to understand or even acknowledge the
need to stand more. These Diseased people have a significant impact on office
productivity. With respect to avoid the adverse effects of poor sitting behavior, the
real-time monitoring of sitting posture has received particular attention.
In previous method the sitting positions are monitored, and the mechanism
involved was moving and bending approach installed in chair and cost is more to get
the soft sitting chair. Due to this, companies face productivity loss as well as the
employees stress level gets increased. To overcome this our project comes up with the
idea of developing a system with low power consumption and low computing overhead
and additional features include a position motor to re-position the chair to the original
position.

# 1.1 ABSTRACT 
Sitting is the most common status of human beings. Some sitting postures may bring
health issues. To overcome, the harm from bad sitting postures, a local sitting posture
recognition system is desired with low power consumption and low computing
overhead. A smart sitting chair model was proposed especially who are all working for
long time in IT sector and in other fields. Our project can categorize eight different
wrong sitting postures of a person who sits and works for a long duration and alerts
them the correct posture to reduce their health issues. This project gives the solution to
avoid health related issues such as, increase in low back pain, cardiovascular disease,
obesity, and diabetes. In this project, sensor modules are used to sense the sitting
postures of the employees. When the person or employee sitting for long time or sitting
in incorrect position, he/she will be given an alert message by our system and our system
take place the person to the correct sitting posture and that should be considered by the
employee. First, the user will be given intimation to their mobile phone or laptop or
desktop via Bluetooth. If the person continues to sit for a long time in the wrong
position, the position motor which is connected using motor driver in our system will
adjust the movement of chair according to the userâ€™s comfortableness. Thus, our
proposed system will bring a beneficial for both office and office employee.
