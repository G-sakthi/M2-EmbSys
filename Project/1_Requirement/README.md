# 1 Introduction
Brushing is one of the most common habit in day to day life of humans. this particula project is to make intrest on brushing for kids by clock, electrical devices set by timmer.My last visit to the dentist convinced me that I should really brush my teeth at least two minutes. 
I decided to build a special toothbrush timer: it would detect when a brush is taken out, measure two minutes and notify when the time is up.
I chose to use Atmega328p, a weight sensor, brass cups, a tray, old alarm clock’s chime and some plywood. I would like to tell how this device was made: what electrical components were used and how I assembled the enclosure. The circuit is designed around a wight sensor. I got one from a used digital scales. It is a pretty basic device: there are four wires: one is input current, one is ground and voltage difference between the other two wires is determined by a weight of an object on the scales. The difference, however, is really small, so one needs to use an amplifier to be able to tell that the weight has changed.

# 1.1 ABSTRACT 
Against the Clock: You can use an actual timer or wall clock that has a second hand to time your child’s brushing. While a kitchen timer will work, there are specially designed timers for brushing teeth that will chime after two minutes. Over time, your child will get the feel for how long brushing teeth for two minutes really takes.
Brushing to a Song: Depending on the song’s length, kids can either brush for the entire song or take “spit breaks” so they can sing along to the chorus and resume brushing after they spit. This makes the process more fun —and the time it takes to brush will probably seem to pass faster.
Brushing During a Commercial Break: Commercials can be a good time for your child to brush their teeth. Commercial breaks average about 2.5 minutes, so there is plenty of time to brush, rinse, and spit before the show comes back on, particularly if the toothbrush is loaded with toothpaste and waiting for the ads to begin. Because your child is already enjoying their show and it comes back when brushing is done, brushing their teeth may not feel as boring to them, and returning to their show is the reward.
Interactive battery-powered or electric toothbrushes with built-in timers are available for kids with fun colors and themes. Some of these toothbrushes coach kids through the entire process, going through the parts of the mouth one by one and even congratulating them at the end.
