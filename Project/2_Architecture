A power supply circuit is used, it consists of step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, filter circuit and voltage regulator. A 230V AC supply is given to the step-down transformer. The step-down transformer will step down the 220V to 12V. 12v is given to the bridge rectifier. A filter section is used to convert pulsating dc to a purer,more desirable form of dc voltage. and the Regulator, it maintains the output of the power supply at a constant level despite large changes in load current or input line voltages. All the components including power supply are connected to the microcontroller. The components are operated by programming the microcontroller using Embedded C. To outline a smart sitting chair capable of measuring the pressure
of the sitting person it was necessary to embedded the force detector sensor into the office chair. The force Sensitive resistor FSR are used to measure the force. The chair flex value detector is a kind of sensor which is used to measure the amount of defection or bending of the chair while the person sitting in the chair, Mems sensor which has three axis dimensions called X,Y and Z dimensions, which monitors
the dimensions of the sitting person in the chair, force detector used to monitor the force given by the respective person sitting in the chair. The monitoring unit comprises of communication protocol module, UART and Bluetooth module.If the person sitting in the wrong position for a long time. Firstly, the notification message is sent to the respective person via Bluetooth or WiFi through mobile phones or desktop. The buzzer will also indicate the employee by giving alert
sound and if the person ignores the notification message and buzzer sound after that the Position motor is driven by the motor driver which is connected to the Arduino microcontroller. The position motor automatically takes the chair to its original position which means sits up straight and keep hips far back in the chair.
